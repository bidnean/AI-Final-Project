# AI-Final-Project

### AiModels

Contains python code for GNB, LinR, LogR, and RFC model creation from .CSV files
## Note that python files require manual entry of which .CSV file to build the model from
This can be done easily by overwriting the line containing:
    filename = "RussianData_in.csv"
The file names should correspond to .CSV files found in RussianData/, which must be placed in the same directory to properly execute

### Results
Contains concise results of AI models (only averages), verbose results of AI models (averages and individual runs), and deprecated results (includes output of model based on older implementations of AI techniques and less effective data formats which have since been removed).

Note that deprecated results are only included for documentation purposes.

### RussianData
Contains all the .CSV files to be used with the AiModels python files to produce each AI model.
